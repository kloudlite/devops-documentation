# Create Environment

Setting up an environment is crucial for your application's deployment:

1. **Access Environment Section:** From your project, go to "Environment" > "Create Environment."
2. **Opt for a Public Environment:** For starters, a public environment can be created which allows routers to be accessible over the public internet without a VPN.
